# GitHub Page?


GitHub Pages is a web hosting service provided by GitHub for hosting static websites. It allows users to easily publish and share web content, such as documentation, personal blogs, project websites, and more. GitHub Pages is tightly integrated with Git and GitHub repositories, making it a popular choice for developers and teams to showcase their work online.

## Key Features

- **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages is offered for free, making it accessible to individual developers, open-source projects, and organizations with budget constraints.

- **Static Websites**: GitHub Pages hosts static websites, which are composed of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets. This approach ensures fast page loading times and improved security.

- **GitHub Integration**: GitHub Pages is tightly integrated with GitHub repositories. You can easily publish a website directly from a repository by following specific naming conventions for branches and directories.

- **Automated Builds**: GitHub Pages supports automatic generation of websites using static site generators like Jekyll. This enables easy content updates with each repository commit.

- **Project Sites**: In addition to user and organization pages, GitHub Pages can be used to host project-specific sites. These project sites are associated with a particular repository.

## Use Cases

- **Project Websites**: Open-source projects often maintain dedicated websites using GitHub Pages to provide information, news, and downloads.

- **Team Pages**: Organizations can use GitHub Pages to share information about their teams, projects, and goals.

## Getting Started

1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Name the repository following specific conventions (e.g., `<username>.github.io` for user pages).
3. Add your HTML, CSS, and other assets to the repository.
4. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository's settings.
5. Optionally, configure a custom domain.

GitHub Pages simplifies the process of hosting web content, making it a valuable tool for developers to share their projects and ideas with a global audience.
